# Movie-Recommendation-Using-R

Introduction and Business Problem: The main goal of this project is to create a recommended system which will take the movies data with movie title, rating and user IDâ€™s of users who have already watched these movies and have rated them. The system will then predict the ratings and will show the top movies which were rated highly by the users, it will also show the worst movies which were rated badly by the users. The top questions which will be answered in the project are as follows:
1.	What are the top 10 highly rated movies in the data?
2.  What are the top 10 worst movies?
3.	Is there any collinearity among the ratings?
